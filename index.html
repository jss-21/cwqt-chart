<div>

  <p>When rainfall exceeds the capacity of the local sewage system, like it did during Hurricane Ida, raw human waste and other runoff flows into nearby waterways. In Brooklyn’s Gowanus neighborhood, the Gowanus Canal bears the brunt of this combined sewage overflow, turning, essentially, into an open toilet.</p>

  <p>Water samples collected by volunteers with the Citizens' Water Quality Testing Program at sites in Gowanus, and elsewhere in the city, measure the levels of Enterococci. These microbes are commonly found in human feces. Their presence in the water samples is a sign that sewage has entered the waterway, and, in turn, pollution and possible pathogens that can have harmful health effects for humans and wildlife.</p>

  <p>“It makes complete sense that there would be higher [Enterococcus] numbers in waterways that are impacted by combined sewer overflows,” said Andrea Silverman, a professor and researcher specializing in wastewater treatment systems. “If you're looking at sampling sites that are way out in the harbor away from these systems [...]  you're not going to see that correlation.”</p>
